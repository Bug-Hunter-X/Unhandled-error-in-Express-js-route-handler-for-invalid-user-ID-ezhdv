This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  the lack of proper error handling when dealing with user input. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, which fails to handle cases where the user ID is not a valid integer. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling to prevent unexpected crashes and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
